# Scala for the Impatient

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/takaczapka/scala-for-the-impatient.png)](https://travis-ci.org/takaczapka/scala-for-the-impatient)

Solutions of exercises from "Scala for the Impatient" book.

### Style
if relevant, each solution has a corresponding test suite. Certain solutions are adjusted to the form which is
testable, i.e. if the exercise asks to print something out, the solution most likely returns values which are
tested against in a suite.

### Motivation
* After 1.5 years spent on a digital detox while travelling through South America I forgot a good amount of coding
practices. Rereading some good books and coding exercises (and hacking around) proved to be an invaluable way to be back on track very fast.
* Some **Scala for the Impatient** exercises in advanced sections can be a bit tricky. I think is good to share
solutions for a future reference and for good of other learners.
