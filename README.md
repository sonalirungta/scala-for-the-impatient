# Scala for the Impatient

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/takaczapka/scala-for-the-impatient.png)](https://travis-ci.org/takaczapka/scala-for-the-impatient)

Solutions of exercises from "Scala for the Impatient" book.

Note that, if relevant, each solution has a corresponding test suite. Certain solutions are adjusted to the form which is testable, i.e. if the exercise asks to print something out, the solution most likely returns values which are validated in a test suite.

Why I'm doing this?
1. After 1.5 years spent on a digital detox travelling through South America I forgot a good amount of practices. Rereading some books proved to be invaluable. Coding it to the highest standards made a relearning process even faster and very practical.
2. Some exercises in advanced part of the book can be a bit tricky. I think is good to share solutions for a future reference and for good of other learners.
